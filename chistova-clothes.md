# The brand

The brand is distinguished from others by its philosophical attitude to the creation of every detail, and the symbiosis of minimalism and classic in one piece. Intellectualism and being unisex are the brand's DNA, which has defined the brand since the first collection. Clothes should be clever and individual because fashion is the best form of self-expression.
