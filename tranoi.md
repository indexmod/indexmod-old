Four times a year during Paris Fashion Week, the Tranoï fashion trade show takes place in prestigious venues and establishes a relationship between creativity and business.
​
Tranoï, which means “between us” in Italian, is an artistic platform that gathers and curates the very best of avant-garde and emerging designers as well as contemporary and leading brands, and puts them in the hands of the most influential players in the fashion industry.
​
More than a commercial gathering, Tranoï features artistic installations, runway shows, parties and an array of events which inspire dreams and desires that are inherent to fashion <span id="a2">[\[2\]](#f2)</span>.
