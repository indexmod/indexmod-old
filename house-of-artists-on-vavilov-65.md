## “Shisha” crisis of 2015

In the middle of 2014 in the room No. 1309 was turned to “Like Shisha”—a hookah with visitors of “dubious appearance”1, an appearance is not peculiar to the people of the house2. On the floor, where they live is formed mud and mountains of calves from cigarette smokers. In the evenings and at night, on weekends, the crime situation develops. A young resident of the house, at the entrance, beat hookah's visitors, it was recorded several CCTV cameras <span id="a2">[\[2\]](#f2)</span>. The hookah's owners have refused to pay, and now (2105) they have accumulated the debt of about 500 000 rubles. The hookah's owners began to cut down electricity for nonpayment, they began to cut the locks on the panel and connect yourself, and not to themselves, but to different neighbors. The police do not work after several contacts, at different levels of local police said that they are good guys, and they should not be touched. Appealing to the prosecutor's office does not have the same result.3 At the end of 2015, a little wave of publicity get risen after publications at Facebook, but the situation is still at the same stage <span id="a3">[\[3\]](#f3)</span>.
