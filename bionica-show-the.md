is a Luxurious Performance & Dance Theatre based on natural philosophy and Buddhism. These stunning and unique stories are told through the eyes of visionary designers Haik Simonyan and Fedor Dodonov. Their conceptual costumes and magical music will amaze and transport viewers to places only found in the imagination.

Haik and Fedor have masterfully created a mystical world inhabited by characters that take you on a fantastic adventure to a wonderland of galaxies and worlds unknown. Along with suggestive melodies, dances and models able to seduce with their gestures, designers have given birth to a real theatrical performance.

Their brilliant designs are all rigorously produced in Russia and processed at their atelier in Moscow. Natural materials like textile, leather, and wool are used to create the visually stunning and intricate detail while artificial materials are used only to create the frames and skeletons of the more structures dresses.

The Bionica Show performances have been seen at events across Russia and internationally including The Alternative Hair Show (Los Angeles, London, Moscow), APEC-2012 Vladivostok, World Economic Forum in Davos, and other corporate and private events all over the World <span id="a2">[\[2\]](#f2)</span>.
