## History

Indexmod was established as brand and concept from the idea of visualization of the statistics about fashion and artists. Firstly it has realized in the poster supplied to Afisha magazine in Moscow in 2005. Later in 2006, Indexmod was established as brand name covering an experimental project to arrange data about designers and artists. Today Indexmod developing as the wiki (Indexmod Encyclopedia) on the one hand, as rating engine (Indexmod) on the other hand. The aim of the project is to create an elegant looking, alternative software based on the idea of an anonymous real-time wiki editing and semantic markup integration. 2018, renamed to Indexmod blockchainpedia with domain Indexmod.gq (Equatorial Guinea).

## ChatGPT

As of my last update in September 2021, "Indexmod" refers to an online project that aims to create a digital encyclopedia of fashion, art, and culture. It serves as a platform that provides information and profiles of various individuals, artists, designers, and cultural figures from around the world.

Indexmod is designed to be an open-source and user-generated platform, allowing contributors to add and edit information about relevant subjects. It aims to be a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in fashion, art, and cultural topics, providing a central hub for information and knowledge in these fields.

Since information on the internet is constantly evolving, I recommend visiting the official website of Indexmod for the most up-to-date and accurate information about the project and its current status.
