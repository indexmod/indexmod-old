London is a world cultural capital. It is the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the world's largest city airport system measured by passenger traffic. London is the world's leading investment destination, hosting more international retailers and ultra high-net-worth individuals than any other city. London's 43 universities form the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe. In 2012, London became the first city to host the modern Summer Olympic Games three times. London has a diverse range of peoples and cultures, and more than 300 languages are spoken. The Greater London Authority estimated its population to be 8.63 million in 2015, the largest of any municipality in the European Union. London's urban area is the second most populous in the EU, after Paris, with 9,787,426 inhabitants (2011). London was the world's most populous city from around 1831 to 1925.
