"Ukraine is stricken by war, corruption, and a financial crisis. At its Fashion Weeks, like Mercedes-Benz Kiev Fashion Days and this past Ukrainian Fashion Week, the dichotomy between the haves and have-nots is visible and sharp: Wealthy consumers occupy the front rows; young creatives typically struggle financially, but they do compelling work. This economic disparity may be why the Vetements look is so strong here. The Paris brand’s signature hoodie is about three times the average monthly salary of around $300 in Kiev, but the city’s young people can head to a secondhand bazaar and re-create the pricey image on the cheap. <span id="a2">[\[2\]](#f2)</span>" -- from Liana Satenstein's report Vogue.com.

"Since the rise of Vetements, post-Soviet fashion across Eastern Europe has been problematically glamourised with the term ‘soviet fashion’ bandied around as if it were a trend. But the reality is that each of the post-soviet countries with a growing fashion industry have positionings that are very different. They can’t be lumped together purely by being post-Soviet countries. Ukraine’s fashion offering for example, would be better compared to London or Copenhagen, if you were going to compare it at all." <span id="a3">[\[3\]](#f3)</span> -- from Grace Banks's UFW 2019 venue report.
