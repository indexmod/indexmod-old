(Rus. Московский музей современного искусства, est. 1999, Moscow) museum in Russia with activities exclusively on the the 20-th and 21-st centuries founded with the support of the Moscow City Government and Moscow City Department of Culture.

Its founding director was Zurab Tsereteli, President of the Russian Academy of Arts. Museum has five venues in the historic centre of Moscow including main building is situated in Petrovka Street, in the former 18th-century mansion house of merchant Gubin, by the architect Matvey Kazakov. The Museum has three more venues: a building in Ermolaevsky Lane, a gallery in Tverskoy Boulevard, a building of the State Museum of Modern Art of the Russian Academy of Arts, and Zurab Tsereteli Studio Museum.

## The collection

The Museum’s permanent collection represents main stages of the avant-garde: Graphic by Pablo Picasso, Fernand Léger, Joan Miró and Giorgio De Chirico,  sculptures by Salvador Dalí, Armand and Arnaldo Pomodoro, paintings by Henri Rousseau and Françoise Gilot, installations by Yukinori Yanaga. A special emphasis is put on the assembly of Russian avant-garde. Many works have been acquired in European and American galleries and auction houses, and thus returned from abroad to form an integral part of Russian cultural legacy. The highlights include paintings and objects by Kazimir Malevich, Marc Chagall, Natalia Goncharova and Mikhail Larionov, Pavel Filonov and Wassily Kandinsky, Vladimir Tatlin and David Burliuk, as well as sculptures by Alexander Archipenko and Ossip Zadkine. Besides that, the Museum owns a unique collection of works by the famous Georgian artist Niko Pirosmani.

## Activities

The Museum engages in various activities, including research and conservation work and publishing. The Museum publishes «DI» (Dialog Iskusstv / Dialogue of Arts) magazine, heir to the authoritative “Dekorativnoe Iskusstvo” (Decorative Art). One of the Museum’s priorities is to promote young artists, bringing them into contemporary process. With this purpose the Museum launched an education program—the “Independent Workshops” School of Contemporary Art.
