# Biography

Anna was born to an artistic family in Ekaterinburg. She lives and works in Moscow currently. In 2003 Anna created a new brand ChistovaEndourova, which already a year later  has become a headliner during the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Russia.

Since 2013 Chistova is a private brand under which new fashion collections are created as well as costumes for movie stars, theatre actors and  musical industry players.

In 2015 two brands Chistova and Arsenicum joined  together to establish a mutual creative space, Apartment26 studio, which is currently situated in a historical centre Kuznetsky Most and became for them a real place of power and inspiration.

By 2020 Anna’s portfolio consists of more than 20 movies. Her clients are famous movie stars and show business celebrities.
