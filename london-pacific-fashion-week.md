London Pacific Fashion Week (LPFW) was established in October 2012. Originally founded as a fundraiser for British Armed Forces registered charity Help for Heroes in which, over the past 5 years LPFW has continued on as a regular fashion event in the United Kingdom promoting established Pacific Fashion Designers. A champion of Pacific design, art and culture, LPFW acts as a platform for designers living and working in the Pacific to engage with the fashion industry and represent them exclusively in the United Kingdom. To do this, a select number of fashion designers from the Pacific travel to London every September for LPFW, which coincides with London Fashion Week, both to promote their brands and gain further experience in the Global fashion world. While in London they commit to a series of events, see below, allowing the breadth of their work to be showcased to a wide and diverse audience. Having witnessed the connection between fashion, culture and the environment during her time in the fashion industry, founder of LPFW and former Military Service personnel, Fijian-born Ms Ana Lavekau has recently announced that LPFW's theme for the next three years will be 'Climate change in the Pacific' <span id="a2">[\[2\]](#f2)</span>.
