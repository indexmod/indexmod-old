(Rus. Наименьшее) created in 2016, Moscow is an 11-minute video by Victoria Chupahina.

Artist, her mother and sister moving in a lifeless monotone 3D-landscape. At the core of the work is the idea of the impossibility of the women to show their maternal feelings for the man. Finding herself a woman becomes a victim of imagery. But neither a mother nor the image of his wife, sister or daughter is not the end, it is always relative. All these different incarnations, which each take turns, but at the same time, the only way a woman looks for and finds herself.
