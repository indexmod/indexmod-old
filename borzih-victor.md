# Artists and their workshops

Artists and their workshops—is an exhibition hosted by Victor Borzih and Ekaterina Abramova at Muzeon Park of Arts. “The idea of the project arose because of the environment in which I found myself. My studio is located in the legendary House of Artists on Vavilov 65а, I met with the residents and their portraits made in the workplace.”—said Mr. Borzih.
