## From Bio

`Neutral point of view is necessary here`

He often works on the set not only as a photographer, but also as a stylist, creating an image with his famous make-up, he delivers a completely "his" product -- finished and perfect.
He goes his own way, not walking over others, but constantly encountering obstacles and misunderstandings, envy and unprofessionalism, and as a result he created his own style, which is easily recognizable at first sight.

If my work helps to see something hidden inside because of the routine and the influence of someone else's opinion, if it helps to change your attitude to yourself and your life, I have the right to believe that I fulfill my mission! -- Jan says.

As a man of the Renaissance he constantly seeks venue for his creative energy. Now it's also music! He records successful mixes to convey a sense of joy to everyone around him <span id="a1">[\[1\]](#f1)</span>.
